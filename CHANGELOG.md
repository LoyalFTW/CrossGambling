    Some updates:  
    New Design, this new design is because of all the feedback I've been getting about the addon. I will be adding in a ColorChanger in the future.   
    Added all the game modes into 1 button, allowing more space.  
    Added a second tab, this will be where all the settings / toggles go.  
    Added Guild % which can be changed, depending on the amount 10% - 90% is best to use.  
    Added Full Stats button and Fame/Shame (Top 3 winners / Losers) Button.  
    Tested and confirmed working.   
    Added Locolization to addon in next update, looking for people to translate for me. Thanks!
